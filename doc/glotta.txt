1. Glotta.nvim                                            *glotta-glotta.nvim*

With glotta.nvim, you can use your favorite machine translation engines without
having to leave your favorite editor. It makes use of Neovim’s |api-floatwin|
to implement an asynchronous, interactive machine translation interface,
similar to how most of the various machine translation web font-ends work. In
addition to that, other (non-interactive) modes are also supported and if you
try hard enough, glotta.nvim can also be used as an API. In other words, this
plugin is here to help you deal with any γλῶττᾰ
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/γλῶσσα#Ancient_Greek> with the power of
Neovim.

QUICKSTART                                                 *glotta-quickstart*

Run the command `:Glotta<cr>` to open an interactive translation window and
start typing to get an understanding of how things work. Type `g?` in normal
mode or `i_CTRL-/` in insert mode to open a help buffer with available
keybindings. `Glotta` also supports command ranges to initialize the
translation winodw. Further, some optional flags for configuration of the
translation process are available. If you plan to translate frequently, the
command can also be mapped to the following recommended keybindings:

Neovim 0.7+

>
    local opts = {noremap = true, silent = true}
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tr", glotta.motion_translate, opts)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>trr", function() return glotta.motion_translate() .. "_" end, opts)
    vim.keymap.set("x", "<leader>tr", glotta.motion_translate, opts)
<


Neovim 0.6

>
    local opts = {noremap = true, silent = true}
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>tr", [[luaeval("require('glotta').motion_translate()")]], opts)
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>trr", [[luaeval("require('glotta').motion_translate() .. '_'")]], opts)
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("x", "<leader>tr", [[luaeval("require('glotta').motion_translate()")]], opts)
<


The mappings work similarly to the command in that they also allow you to use
ranges. E.g., you can use `3<leader>trr` to populate the translation window
with the next three lines of text. One advantage over the command, however, is
the additional support for |text objects|. You can use `<leader>tris` or
`<leader>trip` to translate the surrounding sentence or paragraph, for example.
Other translation modes like replacing or appending text immediately without
opening an interactive window are also implemented.

SUPPORTED ENGINES                                   *glotta-supported-engines*

The plugin already supports a few different translation engines. If you have
any further suggestions feel free to open an issue
<https://github.com/potamides/glotta.nvim/issues> or pull request
<https://github.com/potamides/glotta.nvim/pulls>! The currently supported
engines are as follows:


- Apertium <https://apertium.org>
- Argos Translate <https://translate.argosopentech.com>
- DeepL <https://www.deepl.com/translator>
- Google Translate <https://translate.google.com> (WIP)
- Yandex Translate <https://translate.yandex.com>


Some of these engines are free and open-source and can be used right off the
bat. However, some are commercial and might require additional setup steps. For
stability reasons, the philosophy of this plugin is to prioritize official API
endpoints for which commercial engines usually require some means of
authentication, e.g., through an API key. If no such key is configured but free
alternative endpoints exist, these are used as fallback options. Note, however,
that these are usually severely rate-limited
<https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/issues/370> and in some instances
produce inferior translations
<https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate/issues/22>. So if you want to use a
commercial engine, configuring authentication is usually recommended.

CONFIGURATION                                           *glotta-configuration*

Glotta.nvim supports a wide range of configuration options. Some essential ones
are listed below. The invocation of `require("glotta").setup()` is optional.

>
    require("glotta").setup{
      engines = {
        -- Configuration for individual engines goes here. To list available engine
        -- identifiers run `:lua =vim.tbl_keys(require("glotta.engines"))`)
        default_engine = "argos"
        yandex = {
          -- Default languages can be defined on a per engine basis. In this case
          -- `:lua =require("glotta.async").run(function()
          -- vim.pretty_print(require("glotta.engines").yandex:languages()) end)`
          -- can be used to list available language identifiers.
          default_source = "auto",
          default_target = "en"
        },
      },
      controls = {
        mappings = {
          edit = {
            n = {
              -- Use this table to add additional mappings for the normal mode in
              -- the translation window. Either strings or function references are
              -- supported.
              ["j"] = "gj",
              ["k"] = "gk"
            }
            i = {
              -- Similar table but for insert mode. Using 'false' disables existing
              -- keybindings.
              ["<C-y>"] = false,
              ["<C-a>"] = package.loaded.glotta.ui.actions.yank_close_translation
            }
          },
          select = {
            n = {
              -- Keybindings here are used in the selection window.
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
